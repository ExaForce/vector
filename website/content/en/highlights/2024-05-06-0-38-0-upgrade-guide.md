## Upgrade guide

### Breaking Changes

#### Vector now requires non-optional environment variables {#strict-env-vars}

Vector has the ability to [interpolate environment variables into its
configuration](/docs/reference/configuration/#environment-variables) as a means of templating
configuration. Now, if an environment variable is undefined, unless the `-` interpolation syntax is
used to provide a default, Vector will output an error and stop.

If you want to have Vector start-up even if an environment variable is undefined you can provide
a default like `${FOO-bar}` to default `FOO` to `bar` if it is unset.

The reasoning for this change is that users often miss the undefined variable warning and are
confused by Vector not behaving as the expected. In particular, this happens when using `$1` in
regex capture groups in VRL without realizing they need to be escaped as `$$1` to avoid
interpolation.
